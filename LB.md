# Load Balancer Solution With Apache

In our set up in Project-7 we had 3 Web Servers and each of them had its own public IP address and public DNS name. A client has to access them by using different URLs, which is not a nice user experience to remember addresses/names of even 3 server, let alone millions of Google servers.

In order to hide all this complexity and to have a single point of access with a single public IP address/name, a Load Balancer can be used. A Load Balancer (LB) distributes clientsâ€™ requests among underlying Web Servers and makes sure that the load is distributed in an optimal way.

Let us take a look at the updated solution architecture with an LB added on top of Web Servers

In this project we add a Load Balancer to disctribute traffic between Web Servers and allow users to access our website using a single URL.

### Task ###
Deploy and configure an Apache Load Balancer for Tooling Website solution on a separate Ubuntu EC2 intance. Make sure that users can be served by Web servers through the Load Balancer.

To simplify, let us implement this solution with 2 Web Servers, the approach will be the same for 3 and more Web Servers.

### Prerequisites

Two RHEL8 Web Servers
One MySQL DB Server (based on Ubuntu 20.04)
One RHEL8 NFS server

### Configure Apache As A Load Balancer

Create an Ubuntu Server 20.04 EC2 instance and name it Project-8-apache-lb, so your EC2 list will look like this:
